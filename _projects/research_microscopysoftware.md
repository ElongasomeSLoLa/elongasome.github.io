Software has been crucial to super-resolution microscopy since the beginning of the field, and we have a longstanding interest in pushing the limits of single molecule methods, especially STORM/ PALM super-resolution microscopy and single molecule tracking, by developing new single molecule image analysis tools.

## Current/ recent software
We host our code on GitHub, you can find it here: [https://github.com/HoldenLab](https://github.com/HoldenLab)

## Older software
- [AutoLase (Micromanager plugin)]( https://github.com/ManleyLab/autolase-plugin), Automatic closed loop control of density of photoactive molecules during PALM experiments.
- [DAOSTORM](https://seamusholden.wordpress.com/2013/06/16/daostorm-update/), multi-emitter fitting for STORM/ PALM.
- [TwoTone](http://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/Users/kapanidis/Group/Main.Software.html), single molecule FRET data analysis software.

## People
*We are currently recruiting a post-doc position to develop new methods for bioimage analysis of single molecule and super-resolution microscopy data - [more information and application portal here]((https://warwick-careers.tal.net/vx/appcentre-ext/brand-4/candidate/so/pm/1/pl/3/opp/77-Research-Fellow-106343-0823/en-GB)).* **Application deadline: 10th September.**
