        I have recently joined the lab as a Postdoctoral Researcher. Prior to that, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Oxford Molecular Motors group, under the supervision of Prof. Richard Berry. I obtained my PhD and BSc from the Physics Department at the University of Warwick.

        In the lab, my focus is developing image processing and data analysis tools for microscopy.
