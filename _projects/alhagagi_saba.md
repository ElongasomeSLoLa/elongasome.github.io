<b>Current Research</b>

Our lab studies how bacterial cells grow and divide, but understanding how these protein complexes are organised can be challenging due of their dynamic and mobile nature.   

Chemical fixation in principle preserves cells to be comparable to their original living state and allows us to take a “snapshot” of what these proteins look like. Using aldehyde-based fixatives such as paraformaldehyde and gluteraldehyde to covalently bind amino acid residues together, a matrix of cross-linked proteins and DNA is formed to stabilise cellular structures. 

However, we know that aldehydes are documented disruptors of native ultrastructure in prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems, introducing artifacts that lead to interpretations typically not observed during live-cell imaging. 

  My current research focuses on the development of a new fixation method for reliable bacterial super-resolution microscopy. I use SIM and SMLM techniques, such as STORM, to validate this.
