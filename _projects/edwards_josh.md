            <p>I studied for an MPhys in physics at the Univeristy of Kent from 2015-2019. During this time I completed two internships in the <a href="https://micronoxford.com/">Micron Bioimaging facility</a> at Oxford Univeristy developing python code to asses abberations in adaptive optics systems and to identify regions of interest in biological samples using machine learining. For my masters project I joined Kent's <a href="https://research.kent.ac.uk/applied-optics/">Applied Optics Group</a> where I worked on a remote focusing infra-red <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43586-022-00162-2">optical coherence microscope</a> for the optical biopsy of skin cancers.</p>
            <p>During my PhD I have developed advanced microscopes including leading the <a href="https://holdenlab.github.io/LifeHackWebsite">LifeHack microscope</a> project.</p>
            <p>I have a strong passion for open science and so all of my work is available through the LifeHack microscope website and the Holden Lab <a href="https://github.com/HoldenLab">GitHub</a></p>

    <h3>LifeHack Microscope</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>the LifeHack microscope is fully capable of SMLM and live cell imaging. Unlike commercial microscopes however, it is intended to be equally useful as a development platform from which to build specialised systems to solve cutting edge problems.</p>

    <h3>ImLock Sample Stabilisation</h3>
    <hr>
    <img src="/assets/img/people/josh_edwards_profile.jpg" width="100%">
    <p>ImLock is an infra-red, image based, 3D sample drift correction tool. Using a hybrid live/post-hoc correction technique I have been able to achieve long term sample stability of ~5nm in Z and ~2nm in XY.</p>
