            <p>I studied for an MPhys in physics at the Univeristy of Kent from 2015-2019. During this time I completed two internships at the <a href="https://micronoxford.com/">Micron Bioimaging facility</a> in Oxford developing python code to asses optical abberations in adaptive optics systems and to identify regions of interest in biological samples using machine learining. For my masters project I joined Kent's <a href="https://research.kent.ac.uk/applied-optics/">Applied Optics Group</a> where I worked on a remote focusing infra-red <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43586-022-00162-2">optical coherence microscope</a> for the optical biopsy of skin cancers.</p>
            <p>Currently I work on the development of advanced microscopes including leading the <a href="https://holdenlab.github.io/LifeHackWebsite">LifeHack microscope</a>.</p>
            <p>I have a strong passion for open science and so all of my work is available through the LifeHack microscope website and The <a href="https://github.com/HoldenLab">Holden Lab GitHub</p>
