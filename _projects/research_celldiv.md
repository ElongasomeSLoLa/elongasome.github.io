How does one cell become two? Cell division is a fundamental feature of any life. In bacteria, it is also of substantial biomedical importance as the target of many of our most sucessful antibiotics, such as the beta-lactams and the last-line-of-defence drug vancomycin.

We focus in particular on two related questions: how does the divisome, the protein complex responsible for dividing the bacterial cell, work as a nanoscale machine, and how do multiple nanoscale divisomes work together and coordinate to divide a micron sized cell?

We primarily use *Bacillus subtilis* as a model organism for this project, with a little bit of work in *Escherichia coli*.

## People
- [David Roberts](https://holdenlab.github.io/projects/roberts_david/), bacterial geneticist and microscopist
- *[We are currently recruiting a senior technician position with a focus on molecular biology](https://warwick-careers.tal.net/vx/lang-en-GB/mobile-0/appcentre-1/brand-4/user-11595/xf-287774c8e052/candidate/so/pm/1/pl/3/opp/229-Senior-Research-Technician-107972-0823/en-GB) to work primarily on cell division. Contract length: 8 years. Full details and application portal are in the above link.* **Application deadline: 26th September.**

- *We will very shortly be recruiting a post-doc in biophysics and super-resolution microscopy on this project.*
