The bacterial cell wall is a large mesh-like material composed of peptidoglycan: long cable-like glycan polymers, linked together by peptide crosslinks. We are interested in understanding how cell wall synthesis enzymes make peptidoglycan at the molecular level.

We are using *in vitro* single molecule fluorescence methods to investigate this question.

## People
We will shortly be recruiting a post-doc position on *in vitro* single molecule biophysics to this project.
