I completed an MSci in Natural Sciences (Physics) from the University of Cambridge, specialising in biological physics, and completed a part II project on the computational modelling of pressure waves in shock tubes for the use on ciliated membranes. I completed my DPhil thesis at the University of Oxford in the lab of Nicole Robb titled: "Fluorescence imaging and modelling of virus
structure and infection". Since March 2023, I have been in the lab of Seamus Holden at the University of Warwick working on [bacterial cell elongation](https://holdenlab.github.io/projects/research_cellelongation/) using single particle tracking and other SRFM methods.
