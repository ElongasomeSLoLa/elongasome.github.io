**Current Research**

Since joining the Holden lab in October 2022, my research has been focussed on one of the most fundamental questions in microbiology: <a href="https://holdenlab.github.io/projects/research_celldiv/">how one bacterial cell divides into two</a>.

Bacteria are surrounded by a peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall which is vital for protecting the cell from lysis due to the high internal osmotic pressure, and in rod-shaped bacteria is also critical for cell shape. Furthermore, PG synthesis is a major target for some of our most effective antibiotics (e.g. the penicillinâ€™s) and is therefore a process of immense current interest.

For bacteria to divide, PG needs to be built inwards at the division site in a precise and coordinated manner without compromising wall integrity (which would result in lysis and cell death). A conserved protein complex, known as the divisome, is critical for initiating and driving cell division, and is composed of cytoskeletal proteins, PG synthesis enzymes and a host of regulatory factors. Since many of the proteins in the divisome are essential, bacterial cell division offers an attractive target for antibiotic discovery.

Using the model Gram-positive bacterium *Bacillus subtilis*, I use a combination of genetics, cell biology and advanced microscopy (single molecule and super-resolution) to study how the proteins and enzymes in the divisome function, both individually and together, to drive the synthesis of septal PG during bacterial division. A longer-term aim is to test our models from *B. subtilis* in a range of other bacterial species, including important pathogens.
