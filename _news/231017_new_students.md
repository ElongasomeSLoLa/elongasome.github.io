[Joe Ratcliffe](/projects/ratcliffe_joe/) *(left)* has joined the lab as an [MIBTP](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/mibtp/) PhD student. He will be working on using advanced light microscopy to study the mode of action of antibiotics in bacteria.

[Saba Alhagagi](/projects/alhagagi_saba/) *(middle)* has joined the lab as an MBio master's project student. She will be working on developing new fixation methods for bacterial super-resolution microscopy.

[Siham Gabow](/projects/gabow_siham/) *(right)* has joined the lab as an MBio master's project student, jointly supervised by [Chris Rodriguez](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/lifesci/people/crodrigues/). She will be studying bacterial sporulation using advanced light microscopy.
