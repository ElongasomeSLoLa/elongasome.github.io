title: New paper on FtsZ-ring condensation
---
In work led by Christian Vanhille-Campos in Andela Saric's lab, and published today in *Nature Physics*, we demonstrate that FtsZ treadmilling drives both assembly and alignment of the cytoskeletal Z-ring which is required for cell division. Andela's lab very much led this one with fantastic theory and simulation work, but we were very happy to contribute some live cell experimental data and discussions. Also with  beautiful *in vitro* atomic force microscopy of FtsZ dynamics by Martin Loose's lab.
