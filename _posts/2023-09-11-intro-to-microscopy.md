This is a list of good microscopy 101 resources for new Holden lab arrivals, which may be useful to others too. Thanks to the sci-twitter community for pointing to or donating many of these resources.

Outstanding, comprehensive online courses on Microscopy *(Holden lab newbies, look at this first)* :
- [iBiology microscopy series](https://www.ibiology.org/online-biology-courses/microscopy-series/)

For quick overviews:
- General microscopy introduction: [BioImagingtoolbox- Guillaume Jacquemet](/assets/pdf/bioimagingtoolbox-guillaume-jacquemet-small.pdf)
- Introduction to microscope optics: [Basics of Optical Microscopy - Nicolas Olivier](/assets/pdf/basics-of-optical-microscopy-nicolas-olivier.pdf)
- Introduction to image analysis: [Image_analysis_lecture__Vincent_Boudreau](/assets/pdf/image_analysis_lecture__vincent_boudreau.pdf)
- [Introduction to advanced microscopy for microbiology - Seamus Holden](/assets/pdf/Mol_Micro_Lecture_5_Holden_Advanced_microscopy_for_microbiology.pdf) (with a few slides borrowed from Nicolas Olivier's lecture above).
- Introduction to microscopy (with a focus on neuroscience): [https://www.scribd.com/document/360138012/Master-Course-2017-Photonic-Imaging-in-Neurobiology-C-Leterrier](https://www.scribd.com/document/360138012/Master-Course-2017-Photonic-Imaging-in-Neurobiology-C-Leterrier)

More detailed microscopy lecture series:
- [Jeff Lichtmann light microscopy lectures](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/op30r8upwk5d0y5/AAAy_KyHesTVy2Tres6lyNa5a?dl=0) (excellent intro to microscopy with a focus on optics):
- Oxford Micron facility Advanced light microscopy course: [http://downloads.micron.ox.ac.uk/lectures/micron_course_2017/](http://downloads.micron.ox.ac.uk/lectures/micron_course_2017/)

Microscope manufacturer tutorials:
- [Nikon MicroscopyU](https://www.microscopyu.com/)
- [Zeiss Campus](http://zeiss-campus.magnet.fsu.edu/tutorials/)
- [Olympus resource centre](https://www.olympus-lifescience.com/en/microscope-resource/)

Other commercial resources:
- [Thermo-Fisher school of fluorescence](https://www.thermofisher.com/uk/en/home/life-science/cell-analysis/cell-analysis-learning-center/molecular-probes-school-of-fluorescence.html)

Key textbooks
-  "Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy" by Lakowicz, **the** reference text for fluorescence microscopy. *(a private copy for lab members is on our server)*
- [Single-Molecule Techniques: A Laboratory Manual](https://t.co/nkbPA7D0yH), Editor TJ Ha, an excellent single molecule protocols book, a little dated but still very useful
