Our interdisciplinary team includes scientists from multiple fields, including quantitative biology, microbiology, biochemistry, microscopy and physics. If you are interested in joining the lab, get in touch!

We are always open to informal enquiries for vacation studentships, PhD or Post-doctoral positions in this lab, and often find a way to fund good candidates. International PhD candidates who can secure their own funding are welcomed.

We are very happy to host post-doctoral fellowship applications in the lab and can offer advice and feedback on such applications to suitable candidates. If you are considering an application such as EMBO LTF, Marie Curie IEF or another scheme, do get in touch.

If you would like more information about a specific position, or would just like to make general recruitment or studentship enquiries, please email [seamus.holden@warwick.ac.uk](seamus.holden@warwick.ac.uk) with CV.
