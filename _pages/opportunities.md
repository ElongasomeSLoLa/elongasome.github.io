Our interdisciplinary team includes scientists from multiple fields, including quantitative biology, microbiology, biochemistry, microscopy and physics. If you are interested in joining the lab, get in touch!

We are always open to informal enquiries for vacation studentships, PhD or Post-doctoral positions in this lab, and often find a way to fund good candidates. International PhD candidates who can secure their own funding are welcomed.

We are very happy to host post-doctoral fellowship applications in the lab and can offer advice and feedback on such applications to suitable candidates. If you are considering an application such as Wellcome Early Career Award, BBSRC Discovery Fellowship EMBO LTF, Marie Curie IEF or another scheme, do get in touch.

If you would like more information about a specific position, or would just like to make general recruitment or studentship enquiries, please email [seamus.holden@warwick.ac.uk](seamus.holden@warwick.ac.uk) with CV.

## Upcoming

- PhD positions: The primary path to a PhD in the lab is through two excellent doctoral training programmes: the [BBSRC MIBTP PhD training programme](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/mibtp/) and the [Warwick MRC DTP](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/med/study/mrcdtp/). We are happy to host both rotation projects and main PhD projects. If you are interested, get in touch by [email](seamus.holden@warwick.ac.uk) Applications to both of these programmes for 2024 entry have closed but if you are interested in applying for next year's programmes please get in touch!

## Undergraduate and MBio research projects

Each year we host third and foruth year undergraduate research projects for Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences students studying in our department (School of Life Sciences). If you are a third year student interested in pursuing a project in our lab, you can find out under the "Teaching and Supervision" tab of [SÃ©amus Holden's departmental web page](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/lifesci/people/sholden/). If you are interested in doing a fourth year MBio project in the lab please have a look at our [Research](/research/) page to get a general overview of what we are up to and then please get in touch.

## Equality statement

In the Holden lab, we welcome and celebrate diversity in all its forms. We particularly welcome applications from women, BAME individuals or persons from backgrounds otherwise underrepresented in STEM.
