Welcome to the website of the Holden Lab. We are based at the University of Warwick, near Coventry, UK. We are a diverse group of interdisciplinary scientists who study bacterial cell biology and biophysics using super-resolution microscopy and other advanced imaging methods. Our primary biological focus is how bacteria remodel their cell wall, which is one of the most important targetsâ€‹ for antibiotics.


Key research themes:

- Mechanistic principles of bacterial cell wall remodelling
- Single molecule & super-resolution microscopy
- Open source scientific software and hardware
