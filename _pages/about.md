We use advanced light microscopy to figure out how bacteria grow and divide. We study how proteins act as tiny nanoscale machines to build complex biological structures, with a particular focus on how bacteria remodel their cell envelope, which is one of the most important targetsâ€‹ for antibiotics. To achieve this we use super-resolution microscopy to follow the activity of individual proteins at nanoscale resolution inside live bacteria
