**We use advanced light microscopy to figure out how bacteria grow and divide. **

Key research themes:

- Mechanistic principles of bacterial cell wall remodelling
- Single molecule & super-resolution microscopy
- Open source scientific software and hardware

We study how proteins act as tiny nanoscale machines to build complex biological structures. We primarily focus on how bacteria remodel their cell wall, which is one of the most important targetsâ€‹ for antibiotics. To achieve this we use super-resolution microscopy to follow the activity of individual proteins at nanoscale resolution inside live bacteria
