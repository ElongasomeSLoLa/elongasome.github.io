Welcome to the Elongasome sLOLA project website!

We are multi-disciplinary consortium of scientists working to understand the molecular basis of  bacterial cell wall synthesis by the elongasome protein complex. 

The elongasome is a protein complex that builds the cell wall of rod-shaped bacteria. This protein complex is a major antibiotic target and is found in many bacteria, including major pathogens such as *Eschericia coli* and *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*.

This project is funded by the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council *Strategic Longer and Larger (sLOLA)* initiative.
